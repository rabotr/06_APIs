Observations:
1 Cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity do not seem to be related to closeness to the equator. 
2 Temperature increases as you get closer to the equator
3 We may be able to see other relationships if we use different graphics to visualize the data. It would also be neat to incorporate elevation of each location because that could play a factor in temperature, wind speed, cloudiness, and humidity.
